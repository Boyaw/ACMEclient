# ACMEclient
ACME Project in FS2020 Network Security in ETH Zurich. 

# How to run
Please read [this post](https://n.ethz.ch/~boywang/acme.html). 

# Disclaimer
This implementation is not conprehensive. 
It doesn't necessarily follow the ACME RFC. 
So use it at your own risk. 

For peer students from ETH Zurich, please do not use it for cheating. 
After all, what is the point of passing all the tests without learning anything about ACME?
